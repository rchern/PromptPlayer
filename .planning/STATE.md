# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-20)

**Core value:** Enable a presenter to walk their team through a real Claude Code / GSD workflow step by step
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Data Pipeline (COMPLETE)

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 10 (Data Pipeline) -- PHASE COMPLETE
Plan: 4 of 4 in current phase
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-02-21 - Completed 02-04-PLAN.md (Builder session browse UI, end-to-end pipeline verification)

Progress: [██████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 6/34 plans (~18%)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 6
- Average duration: 5.3min
- Total execution time: 0.53 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. App Shell | 2/2 | 14min | 7min |
| 2. Data Pipeline | 4/4 | 18min | 4.5min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 4min, 6min, 2min, 2min, 8min
- Trend: stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Electron + React + TypeScript stack (from research phase)
- Roadmap: 5-stage pipeline architecture (Parser -> Stitcher -> Classifier -> Engine -> Controller)
- Roadmap: Builder and Player share rendering components (Phase 5 reuses Phase 3 renderers)
- 01-01: electron-vite 3.x (not 5.x) -- resolved from npm, works with Electron 40 + Vite 6
- 01-01: JSON file persistence instead of electron-store (ESM/CJS incompatibility)
- 01-01: React.JSX.Element return types for React 19 compatibility
- 01-01: moduleResolution: bundler in tsconfig.node.json for @tailwindcss/vite
- 01-02: RootLayout with Outlet for nested routing (Titlebar shared across all routes)
- 01-02: WindowControls extracted as separate component from Titlebar
- 02-01: Thinking-only messages classified as plumbing (hidden by default)
- 02-01: Unknown tools default to 'unknown' visibility (shown by default -- safe behavior)
- 02-01: Parser returns unordered messages; ordering is stitcher's responsibility
- 02-01: pairToolResults runs post-stitch so tool_use always precedes tool_result
- 02-02: Deferred app.getPath('userData') resolution via function instead of module-level constant (avoids crash before app.whenReady)
- 02-02: 50-line scan limit for fast metadata extraction (later increased to 150 in 02-04)
- 02-02: Error-as-data pattern (parseError field) instead of thrown exceptions for unreadable files
- 02-03: Preload uses unknown return types -- thin bridge, renderer types provide actual typing
- 02-03: pipeline:parseSession runs full pipeline in one IPC call (parse -> stitch+classify -> return)
- 02-03: Zustand store refreshes storedSessions after save/remove for consistency
- 02-04: Command name preferred over first user message for session identification (GSD sessions show /gsd:command instead of first reply)
- 02-04: Boring commands (/clear, /help, /compact, /init) skipped in snippet extraction
- 02-04: Project groups sorted by most recent session, not alphabetically
- 02-04: Metadata scan increased from 50 to 150 lines for better coverage

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ~~Claude Code JSONL schema must be verified against real files before finalizing Parser (Phase 2)~~ RESOLVED: schema verified in 02-RESEARCH.md against 64 real files
- ~~npm package versions need verification before project scaffold (Phase 1)~~ RESOLVED: versions verified during 01-01 execution
- AskUserQuestion tool call schema assumed but unverified (Phase 9)
- electron-store v11 ESM-only incompatible with electron-vite 3.x CJS output -- using JSON file fallback
- npm audit reports 10 high severity vulnerabilities in eslint dependency chain -- review before packaging
- Stitcher orphan count always equals message count (parentUuid chain walking not finding root -- likely null vs undefined check). Needs investigation before Phase 3 relies on orphan data.
- Metadata scan message count differs from full parse count (expected: scan approximates, full parse does assistant turn reassembly). Not a bug, but worth documenting for users.
